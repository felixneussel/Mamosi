\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ray tracing is model for approximating global illumination of scene as described by rendering equation
    \pause
    \item Specular reflection depicted well, diffuse reflection limited
    \pause
    \item Foundation for other algorithms which improve diffuse reflection, e.g. path tracing
    \pause
    \item Applications: video games and animated motion pictures, ...
    \pause
    \item Real time rendering requires implementation in compiled
    language and GPU
